# Fighting for the Freedom and Tolerance of Viruses, in Every Form

PETV focuses its attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of viruses suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: in laboratories, in the food industry, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment industry.

PETV works through public education, virus hosting, virus incubation, virus mutation, cruelty investigations, anti-anti-virus software, research, virus rescue, legislation, special events, celebrity involvement, and protest campaigns.
